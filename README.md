# Anime Recomendator
This webscraper opens your Myanimelist profile using your username only.
After looking you up, it identifies your animes marked in your "Favorite" tab.
Once found, it enter those animes and look for user recomendations based on that anime.

This program features a very basic UI too, where the user can:
  
    See the cover of the recommended anime,
    See the number of people that recommended that anime,
    Click a button to see the recommendation in more details,
    Click a button to look up the anime in gogoanime.ai (May change in the future).
    
The web scraing process takes longer if you have multiple animes marked as favorites, so it may take a while to yield results depending on how many animes you have marked.

# How to use it

Simply put your username in the textbox, press the button and wait. If the process takes more than two minutes and you don't have too many animes marked as favorites, try restarting the app. If it still does not work, open an Issue and I'll see what I can do
